Okay, it seems like we're entering the 21st century at last. I'm so tired of doing everything through through a commmand line. I realize that I can't aviod the command line, but at least I can do something that makes more sense to me. I'm sorry to all of those who believe that the command line is quicker and simpler, but a drag-and-drop makes a lot more sense and is much quicker to me.

To answer your question, having a remote repository makes a lot of sense to me. If the project has to be shared, which is probably a regular occurrence in the workplace, or even amongst friends and allies outside of the workplace, then everyone can be on the same page. Another advantage of a remote repostitory is if your computer should decide to die, which has happened to me at the most inopportune times, then at least some version of your work is safe somewhere else. You may have to rework whatever you were doing but you don't have to start from the ground up. Then you'd have to wonder what killed your system and if it had anything to do with whatever you were working on when it died.
